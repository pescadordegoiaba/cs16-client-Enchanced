* Fixed MOTD; please report any bugs



Play On Manjaro Arch:
```
🐧 ARCH LINUX — Enable 32-bit
🔧 1. Enable the multilib repository

Edit:

sudo nano /etc/pacman.conf

Uncomment:

[multilib]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
🔄 2. Update the system
sudo pacman -Syu
📦 3. Install 32-bit dependencies
sudo pacman -S \
lib32-mesa \
lib32-libglvnd \
lib32-sdl2 \
lib32-sdl2_image \
lib32-openal \
lib32-libpulse \
lib32-zlib \
lib32-libpng \
lib32-libjpeg-turbo
✅ 4. (Optional) Useful tools
sudo pacman -S ldd file
🐧 DEBIAN / UBUNTU — enable 32-bit
🔧 1. Enable i386 architecture
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
🔄 2. Update
sudo apt update
📦 3. Install 32-bit dependencies
sudo apt install -y \
libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 \
libgl1-mesa-dri:i386 \
libsdl2-2.0-0:i386 \
libsdl2-image-2.0-0:i386 \
libopenal1:i386 \
libpulse0:i386 \
zlib1g:i386 \
libpng16-16:i386 \
libjpeg-turbo8:i386
✅ 4. (Optional) Tools
sudo apt install file
🔍 HOW TO CHECK WHAT'S MISSING

You must know this command:

ldd ./xash3d | grep “not found”

Example output:

libSDL2.so.0 => not found
libopenal.so.1 => not found

👉 Install the corresponding 32-bit version

⚠️ COMMON ERRORS
❌ “No such file or directory”

→ Usually missing 32-bit libc

❌ “wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64”

→ you mixed 64-bit with a 32-bit binary

❌ crash without error

→ usually OpenGL or driver
```

## Installation
To run CS16Client you need the [latest developer build of Xash3D FWGS](https://github.com/FWGS/xash3d-fwgs/releases/tag/continuous).
You have to own the [game on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/10/CounterStrike//) and copy `valve` and `cstrike` folders into your Xash3D FWGS directory.
After that, just install the APK and run.
